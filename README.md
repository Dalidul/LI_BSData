Horus Heresy: Legions Imperialis - dalidul's patch
==================

## Overview ##

__What's this?__

This project bases on [Legions Imperialis BSData organisation's project][BSData LI repo].

It is fun-made modification of Games Workshop's Horus Heresy: Legions Imperialis boardgame.

In `master` branch you'll find a version of original datesheets/rules with a minimal amount of obvious misprints/useless loadout option fixes.

In `rework` branch you'll find a total rebalance, with adding new units and weapon options which GW didn't released yet. To get minitures for some of them you could use 3D-printed models which is developed by community.

[Here you can find the changelog file with designer's commentaries][changelog]
